## 100 Days is Too Long

_100 Days of Code_ (https://www.100daysofcode.com/), and many subsequent inspirations, became famous 
for motivating people to get up to speed as a programmer,
and we applaud those efforts.

With the emergence of AI tools to help people create software code, writing software can
be accelerated by 2X, 3X, maybe even 5X. Even after working around the AI hallucinations (which
are rapidly decreasing), using those tools to help us write code is truly a game-changer.

It follows, then, that getting up to speed on creating AI _applications_ (meaning: software that
uses AI tools) shouldn't take us the same 100 days that it used to take just to learn a single
programming language and toolset.

> Could it take longer? Should it take less time? 

So yeah, the pure "coding" part should be way faster these days, but we're talking about figuring
out how to create software applications that use AI under the covers. This will be more difficult (and require different skills) than manually slinging programming 
code.
- To avoid spending cycles debating the future, we take inspiration from Douglas Adams, 
who famously suggested that the answer to The Ultimate Question is **42**.

## Our Motivations

Like most people, we cannot escape the relentless hype about how AI will either 1) revolutionize
our world, or 2) destroy it and us (probably us first). None of us can know what will happen, but
all of us who are around software can recognize that this current tidal wave of AI innovations is making 
fundamental changes in the way software is built and maintained. We don't accept the popular hallucinations
by many C-suite executives about being able to fire all their programmers before the next quartely 
numbers are reported, but we do have the following positions:

1. **People who are now learning how to create software should use AI tools instead of learning to code manually.**
1. **The biggest payoff from AI will be creating AI _applications_ that take business process automation to the next level
 while also providing transparency to and oversight by their human owners.**
