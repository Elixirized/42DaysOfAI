## 100 Days is Too Long

_100 Days of Code_ (https://www.100daysofcode.com/), and many subsequent inspirations, became famous 
for motivating people to get up to speed as a programmer,
and we applaud those efforts.

With the emergence of AI tools to help people create software code, writing software can
be accelerated by 2X, 3X, maybe even 5X. Even after working around the AI hallucinations (which
are rapidly decreasing), using those tools to help us write code is truly a game-changer.

It follows, then, that getting up to speed on creating AI _applications_ (meaning: software that
uses AI tools) shouldn't take us the same 100 days that it used to take just to learn a single
programming language and toolset.

> Could it take longer? Should it take less time? 

So yeah, the pure "coding" part should be way faster these days, but we're talking about figuring
out how to create software applications that use AI under the covers. This will be more difficult (and require different skills) than manually slinging programming 
code.
- To avoid spending cycles debating the future, we take inspiration from Douglas Adams, 
who famously suggested that the answer to The Ultimate Question is **42**.

## Our Motivation

It's impossible to escape the relentless hype about how AI will either 1) revolutionize
our world, or 2) destroy it and us (probably us first). None of us can know what will happen, but
all of us who are around software can recognize that this current tidal wave of AI innovations is making 
fundamental changes in the way software is built and maintained. We don't accept the popular hallucinations
by many C-suite executives about being able to fire all their programmers before the next quartely 
numbers are reported, but we do have the following positions:

1. **People who are now learning how to create software should use AI tools instead of learning 
to code manually.**
1. **The biggest payoff from AI will be creating AI _applications_ that take business process 
automation to the next level
 while also providing transparency to and oversight by their human owners.**

These two assertions drive our core objective to get people who participate in 
this adventure proficient in creating ("coding") _AI applications_ that are meaningful and 
manageable.

## Too Ambitious?

Time will tell. What we don't want people to experience is yet another "toy" tutorial experience,
so we go deeper than the typical tutorial series. This includes real-world issues like production
deployments, and it means real-world considerations like the limits--and governance--of AI. 

We can't promise that you will get a high-paying AI job, but our goal is for all of us to become proficient
at transforming ideas into working/deployed AI applications that make us (and our bosses and clients)
at the leading edge of the pragmatic (and *responsible*) use of AI.
