## Welcome to your AI adventure!

You've heard of <em>100 Days of Code</em> and <em>100 Days of Python</em>, and 
you are certainly aware of all the excitement about AI--but shouldn't 
AI make things go **_faster_**? We think so too. That's why this is  ***42 Days*** of AI. See the [About](./about) 
page for more philosophical details.

With <b>six weeks</b> (42 days) of content, we'll go from <em>AI zero</em>
to <b>AI hero</b>, as we work our way up to a mind-blowing capstone project: a web app that <b>keeps itself 
updated</b>, evolving as the AI landscape continues to evolve at its torrid pace. 

> Yeah, our minds are blown too. ðŸ˜Ž Imagine code (and _docs_) that never go out of date. 

## Our Roadmap ðŸš€ 

We don't know exactly how we are going to get there--but how could we? New AI 
tools and techniques are being continually released, so this journey will change as the AI landscape
evolve. Here are the skills we will iteratively build and refine:

- âœ… AI Coding Tools & Libraries (VSCode, etc.)
- âœ… Prompt Engineering for Coding ("Vibe Coding")
- âœ… Proficiency with the top N BigCo AI APIs
- âœ… Production deployment of AI-driven applications
- âœ… Testing AI logic and AI agents (AI, test thyself?)
- âœ… AI-driven Application Maintenance
- âœ… Local LLM APIs (alternatives to BigCo commercial options)

We can't promise how much time each "day" will take; some may take an hour or less; others
may take an hour or two. 

We are confident that if you stick with this, you will know more about creating and 
shipping AI functionality than 99 percent of world.
