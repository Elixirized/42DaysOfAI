# 🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

Day 1 resulted in getting VSCode installed, along with installing and configuring some key 
VS Code extensions. A key outcome of that exercise was seeing the incredible power the 
interactive Jupyter notebook embedded in VSCode, which let's us instantly verify the output of
each line of our code. As we will see during our debugging adventures to come, this is an 
additional productivity multiplier (on top of the rocket fuel that using AI to help us code).

There are more VSCode extensions and Python libraries to come, but we
are intentionally being "incremental" here, taking our time to maximize our focus on AI tools 
and running code while minimizing the time we spend on configuration and administrative cruft. 
So let's see what we can do so far.

## Today: OpenAI API

The first AI API we explore is from OpenAI. (NOTE: If your favorite is Google/Deep Mind, Anthropic, or
another BigLLM firm, don't worry. We will get there.)
