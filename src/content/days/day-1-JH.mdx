# Install VSCode

If you don't already have VSCode installed, go do that [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## VSCode Command Palette

The Command Palette in VS Code is a powerful feature that allows you to quickly access
commands and features by typing their names. It's like a shortcut hub for all the actions
within the editor.

To open it, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac), and start typing your command. It's
awesome because it speeds up your workflow by letting you jump to any function without
navigating through menus or remembering keyboard shortcuts.

# Install VSCode Extensions
# Install VSCode Extensions

To make the most of your Python development experience in VSCode, you'll want to install some essential extensions. Here are a few key extensions that will enhance your workflow:

1. **Python**: This extension provides rich support for Python, including IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and code navigation. It is essential for any Python development in VSCode.
2. **Jupyter**: This extension allows you to work with Jupyter notebooks directly within VSCode. It provides a great interface for running and editing notebooks, making it easier to work with data science projects and AI models.
3. **Pylance**: This is a fast and feature-rich language server for Python, providing improved IntelliSense and type checking. It works seamlessly with the Python extension to enhance your coding experience.
4. **GitLens**: This extension supercharges the built-in Git capabilities of VSCode. It provides insights into code authorship, history, and more, making it easier to collaborate on projects
5. **Prettier - Code formatter**: This extension helps maintain consistent code formatting across your projects. It supports multiple languages, including Python, and can be configured to run automatically on save.
6. **Live Share**: This extension allows you to collaborate in real-time with others directly within VSCode. It's great for pair programming or code reviews.
7. **Docker**: If you're working with containerized applications, this extension provides support for Docker, allowing you to build, manage, and deploy containers directly from VSCode.
8. **Remote - SSH**: This extension allows you to connect to remote machines via SSH and work with files and folders as if they were local. It's useful for working on remote servers or cloud instances.
9. **Bracket Pair Colorizer**: This extension colorizes matching brackets to make it easier to identify code blocks, especially in complex files.
10. **Path Intellisense**: This extension provides autocompletion for file paths in your code, making it easier to navigate and reference files within your project.
11. **Python Extention Pack**: This is a collection of essential Python extensions that includes the Python, Pylance, and Jupyter extensions, among others. It simplifies the setup process by bundling these key tools together.
12. **GitHub Copilot**: This AI-powered code completion tool helps you write code faster and with fewer errors by suggesting entire lines or blocks of code based on your input. It can be a game-changer for productivity, especially in complex projects.
13. **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues**: This extension allows you to manage GitHub pull requests and issues directly within VSCode. It streamlines the code review process and makes it easier to collaborate on projects hosted on GitHub.
14. **Ruff**: This is a fast Python linter that helps you catch errors and enforce coding standards in your Python code. It integrates well with the Python extension and provides real-time feedback as you code.
15. **Better Comments**: This extension helps you create more readable and organized comments in your code by allowing you to categorize comments with different colors and styles. It can improve code readability and make it easier to understand the purpose of different sections of your code.

There are many more extensions available in the VSCode marketplace, but these are some of the most essential ones for Python development and AI projects. You can install them by searching for their names in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac) and clicking the Install button.
