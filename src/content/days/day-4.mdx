  'How would you go about designing a program that keeps itself updated as

  • This will be the outline we use to have AI help us build this.
  • SIDEBAR: Local/open-source LLMs vs. commercial APIs. Things to think about for when we deploy
  (and need to pay for running) our AI applications in the real world.
