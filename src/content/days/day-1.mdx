# Install VSCode

If you don't already have VSCode installed, go do that [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## VSCode Command Palette

The Command Palette in VS Code is a powerful feature that allows you to quickly access
commands and features by typing their names. It's like a shortcut hub for all the actions
within the editor.
To open the Command Palette, you can use the keyboard shortcut:

<img src="/images/cmd+shift+p.png" width="300" alt="Three keyboard keys arranged horizontally: 
cmd with the command symbol, shift with an upward arrow, and P in bold. Plus signs connect the 
keys, illustrating the keyboard shortcut for opening the Command Palette." />

  
To open it, press Cmd+Shift+P **(or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux)**, and start typing your command. It's
awesome because it speeds up your workflow by letting you jump to any function without
navigating through menus or remembering keyboard shortcuts.

## Install Essential VSCode Extensions 

To make the most of your Python development experience in VSCode, you'll want to install 
some essential extensions. Here are a few key extensions that will enhance your workflow:

1. **Python** family: This extension provides rich support for Python, including IntelliSense, 
linting, debugging, and code navigation. It is essential for any Python development in 
VSCode, and it (as of 9/2025) alo installs:
 - **Pylance**: This is a fast and feature-rich language server for Python, providing 
improved IntelliSense and type checking. It works seamlessly with the Python extension 
to enhance your coding experience.
-  **Python Debugger** Debugging support for Visual Studio Code
-  **Python Environments** Visual view of Python virtual environments

2. **Jupyter**: This extension allows you to work with Jupyter notebooks directly within 
VSCode. It provides a great interface for running and editing notebooks, making it easier 
to work with data science projects and AI models.


4. **GitLens**: This extension supercharges the built-in Git capabilities of VSCode. It provides insights into code authorship, history, and more, making it easier to collaborate on projects

5. **Prettier - Code formatter**: This extension helps maintain consistent code formatting across your projects. It supports multiple languages, including Python, and can be configured to run automatically on save.

6. **Live Share**: This extension allows you to collaborate in real-time with others directly within VSCode. It's great for pair programming or code reviews.

7. **Docker**: If you're working with containerized applications, this extension provides support for Docker, allowing you to build, manage, and deploy containers directly from VSCode.

8. **Path Intellisense**: This extension provides autocompletion for file paths in your code, making it easier to navigate and reference files within your project.

9. **GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Claude Code, Gemini**: These AI-powered code completion tools help you write code faster and with fewer errors by suggesting entire lines or blocks of code based on your input.

10. **Ruff**: This is a fast Python linter that helps you catch errors and enforce coding standards in your Python code. It integrates well with the Python extension and provides real-time feedback as you code.

11. **Better Comments**: This extension helps you create more readable and organized comments in your code by allowing you to categorize comments with different colors and styles. It can improve code readability and make it easier to understand the purpose of different sections of your code.

There are many more extensions available in the **VSCode** marketplace, but these are some of the most essential ones for Python development and AI projects. You can install them by searching for their names in the Extensions view **(Cmd+Shift+X on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows/Linux)** and clicking the **Install** button.


# Install Python

Installing Python has different steps on MacOS, Windows and Linux machines, so we start with those 
initial steps for each platform.

[macOS Setup](#macos-setup) ‚Ä¢ [Windows Setup](#windows-setup) ‚Ä¢ [Linux Setup](#linux-setup)

## macOS Setup

### FIRST: Install Homebrew (Package Manager)
```powershell
# Install Homebrew
% /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Add Homebrew to PATH (for Apple Silicon Macs)
% echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
% source ~/.zshrc

# Verify installation
% brew --version
```

### THEN: Install Python
```powershell
# Install latest Python
% brew install python

# Verify installation
% python3 --version
% pip3 --version
```

<br/><br/>
## Windows Setup

### Step 3: Install Python

üìå Go to https://python.org/downloads/ <br/>
üìå Download latest Python 3.x for Windows <br/>
 **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Step 3: Install WSL

üìå Run in PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
% wsl --install
```
üìå Restart computer when prompted <br/>
üìå Create Ubuntu username and password

### Step 3: Update Ubuntu in WSL
```powershell
# Update package lists
% sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install essential tools
% sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git
```

### Step 4: Install Python
```powershell
# Install Python and pip
% sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev

# Verify installation
% python3 --version
% pip3 --version
```
<br/><br/>
## Linux Setup

### Step 1: Update System
```js
# Ubuntu/Debian
% sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
% sudo dnf update -y
# or for older versions: sudo yum update -y
```

### Step 2: Install Python and Dependencies
```js
# Ubuntu/Debian
% sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev build-essential

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
% sudo dnf install -y python3 python3-pip python3-devel gcc gcc-c++ make
```

# Install Poetry

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for Python dependency and project organization/management.

Follow these steps to install Poetry and create/manage Python projects; these are universal instructions 
for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**:

Run this in your terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux):

```js
% curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
<br/>
### 2. Add Poetry to your PATH (if not already)

If `poetry` is not found after install, add it to your PATH:

* **macOS/Linux (bash/zsh)** ‚Üí add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

  ```js
  % export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
  ```

* **Windows (PowerShell)** ‚Üí add this to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`):

  ```powershell
  % $env:Path += ";$env:APPDATA\Python\Scripts"
  ```

Then restart your terminal.

### 3. Verify Installation

```js
% poetry --version
```

You should see the installed version number.

# Create Your Project

Getting a development environment configured can be frustrating--especially for people who 
are new to a team, and especially for newer programmers. Hopefully the previous steps were a pain-free 
experience for you. 

So let's finally **build something!!**.

<br/>
## 1. Create/Initialize Syntax

```js
% poetry new my_project
% cd my_project
```
This generates a standard Python/Poetry project structure for (in this case) the project called "my_project":

```
my_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_project/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
```

Now we tell Poetry to initialize our project:

```js
% poetry install
```

Think of **`poetry install`** as ‚Äúset up my project environment.‚Äù This command:

- Reads `pyproject.toml` (and poetry.lock if present).
- Creates or updates the project‚Äôs virtual environment.
- Installs:
  - Your project itself (editable install, so imports work).
  - All declared dependencies ([tool.poetry.dependencies] and optionally dev groups as listed in our `pyproject.toml` file [more on this file below]).
- If `poetry.lock` exists ‚Üí installs the exact versions recorded.
- If `poetry.lock` doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Üí this resolves versions, installs them, and generates our lockfile (`poetry.lock`).

üìå Typical use cases:
- The first time you create (or clone -- like cloning a remote repo) a project ‚Üí **`poetry install`** to get a working virtual environment ("venv").
- Any time dependencies change in `pyproject.toml` or `poetry.lock` and you want those dependencies updated.

<br/>
## 2. Configure Your Python Version (if needed)

Quick sanity check (runs Python inside Poetry‚Äôs environment in our project):

```js
% poetry run python -V
```

Inside `pyproject.toml`, Poetry will configured a default Python constraint. You can edit it:

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.12"
...
```
<div style="display: flex; gap:1rem; margin:2rem 0;">
  <Sidebar>
    <PythonVersions />
  </Sidebar>
</div>

<br/>
## 3. Activating the Virtual Environment

A core principle in the Python world is to isolate dependencies so that a package or library used 
by one Python project doesn't affect another Python project. This is a key 
differentiator between Python projects and projects created in most other languages and application 
frameworks. If you have experienced the "dependency Hell" of global package installations breaking 
multiple projects, you will appreciate the refreshing lack of that issue with Python projects--**if** you 
follow the convention of "virtual environments" which enable this dependency isolation.

Unlike other Python package managers (like `pip`, the default package manager for Python), Poetry 
manages virtual environments for each project, and we illustrated **creating** the virtual 
environment with the **`poetry install`** command above. 

üëâ You _activate_ the virtual environment in MacOS and Linux with **`eval $(poetry env activate).`** 
In Windows Powershell the syntax is **`Invoke-Expression (poetry env activate).`** In both cases, your 
terminal command prompt changes to let you know the virtual environment is activate. In my case:
```js 
(my-project-py3.13) %
```

<br/>
## 4. Add Dependencies

We will use Jupyter notebooks embedded in VS Code; this installs those dependencies in our project:

```js
% poetry add --group dev ipykernel jupyter
```

- The `--group dev` flag specifies (in our `pyproject.toml` file) that these are Development-only dependencies.

Here is our `pyproject.toml` file now:
```js 
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = [
    {name = "42DaysOfAI Team",email = "agentic.dudes@42daysofAI.com"}
]
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
]

[tool.poetry]
packages = [{include = "my_project", from = "src"}]

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
ipykernel = "^6.30.1"
jupyter = "^1.1.1"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=2.0.0,<3.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

This seemingly simple installation command takes our project from an empty list of installed Python libraries (via **`poetry show`**) to something like this:

## 5. Initialize Git

First: Go create an **empty** repo in your GitHub (or GitLab) account. In this example we are using the 
empty repo named "Day-1" in the 42DaysOfAI GitHub organization. Your "Day-1" repo will be under 
your GitHub/GitLab account name.

Back to your terminal session, be sure you are in your project's root folder:

```js
% cd my_project
```

Now initialize your local git repo:

```js
% git init

Initialized empty Git repository in <path-to-your-project>/.git/
```
Next, we connect our local repo to our empty GitHub repo we created in the "First" step above:

```js
% git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-GitHub-account-name>/Day-1.git
```
Verify that this worked:

```js
% git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/<your-GitHub-account-name>/Day-1.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/<your-GitHub-account-name>/Day-1.git (push)

```
Now ask for the status of files in your local repo:

```js
% git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	README.md         # Text is RED
	poetry.lock       # Text is RED
	pyproject.toml    # Text is RED
	src/              # Text is RED
	tests/            # Text is RED

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
Tell git you want to add all the files (everything shown above) to the set files to be commited to the repo:

```js
% git add .
```

Confirm that status now:

```js
% git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   README.md                         # File names will now be GREEN
	new file:   poetry.lock                       # File names will now be GREEN
	new file:   pyproject.toml                    # File names will now be GREEN
	new file:   src/my_project/__init__.py        # File names will now be GREEN
	new file:   tests/__init__.py                 # File names will now be GREEN
```

Now tell Git to save the current state of this project, and label it as the very first version with the commit 
comment of "Initial commit.‚Äù 

```js
% git commit -m "Initial commit"
[main (root-commit) d16e626] Initial commit
 5 files changed, 2405 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
 create mode 100644 poetry.lock
 create mode 100644 pyproject.toml
 create mode 100644 src/my_project/__init__.py
 create mode 100644 tests/__init__.py
```
Finally, send this "committed" state of our project to update our remote repo on GitHub:

```js
% git push -u origin main
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Delta compression using up to 10 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 50.16 KiB | 12.54 MiB/s, done.
Total 7 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
To https://github.com/42DaysOfAI/Day-1.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

You can now go back to your GitHub repo page (at https://github.com/your-GitHub-account-name/Day-1, using this example) and refresh your browser. You will see somethig like this:

## Day 1 Recap

Today, we set up our development environment for building business web applications using Python. 
We installed VSCode, configured essential extensions, and set up a virtual environment. 
We also explored the Jupyter notebook interface and created a simple web application, as well 
as installed essential libraries for data handling, visualization, and web development.

We learned how to create a project structure that is easy to navigate and maintain and also 
discussed best practices for managing dependencies, using virtual environments, and documenting 
our code. 

The importance of using version control with Git and keeping our requirements.txt file updated 
was discussed, and we learned how to use .env files to manage sensitive data and environment variables.

Discussing the importance of documenting our code and using comments to explain complex logic, 
we learned how to use MDX to create documentation files and how to use Jupyter notebooks to 
create interactive documentation.

This information provides a solid foundation for developing business web applications with 
Python and Jupyter Notebooks, we will discuss essential libraries across all major platforms 
in more depth in the coming days. Also, the face of **AI development changes day to day**, and 
we will be updating this as we go along.
