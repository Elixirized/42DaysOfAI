title: "Content Outline"
description: |
  Evolving (high-level) outline of the content we envision for our 42 days of AI.
---

This list will evolve as we learn more while creating and testing the content and responding to you feedback.

* As content is created, you will see the description for each "Day N" item in the list become more detailed than
what is listed here.
* Each day will (or may?) include a **sidebar** discussion that hints at future
content and/or provide an introduction to a topic that can be explored more deeply outside of the "Day N" effort.
* Each day will include a set of **references** for diving deeper into that day's topics and tools.
