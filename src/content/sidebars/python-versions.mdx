### Sidebar: **`python3 --version`** vs. **`poetry run python -V`**

If you run both of these commands, you may notice differences reported, such as:

**`poetry run python -V`**
returns "Python 3.12.9" 

 **`python3 --version`** 
 returns "Python 3.13.3"

#### What this means for your versions

- Your current venv (virtual environment) shows 3.12.9 because that’s the interpreter Poetry 
used when it created the venv.
- Your system python3 is 3.13.3, which also satisfies >=3.12, but Poetry won’t switch 
interpreters automatically.

**If you want Poetry to use 3.13 (for example) now:**
```
poetry env use python3.13      # use the Python 3.13 interpreter
poetry install                 # recreate/resolve for that interpreter
poetry run python -V           # should now show 3.13.x
```

Note that the command **`poetry env use python3.13`** is causing Poetry to "tell" the project: 
“from now on, use this interpreter when creating/running the virtual env.”
