#### Terminal Commands & Interactions

```
Commands we type, along with the response (when applicable) will be in a box like this.
```
More specifically, within that box, the commands we type will be shown with a preceding "**%**" 
(a common command prompt in many terminal programs), and the response will NOT have that command 
prompt "%" character.

Here's an example:

```
% poetry run python -V
Python 3.12.9
```
