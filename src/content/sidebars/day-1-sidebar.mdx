### Sidebar: Day 1


We will iterate on VSCode extensions and Python libraries throughout our adventure, culminating with an “ideal” set of configurations, etc. Much of what is here is tested on MacOs Sequoia, yet the other OS versions are covered. Adjustments might need to be made for Windows (WSL) or Linux. This is a technical setup day, so do not worry if you don't understand everything. We will be using these tools throughout the course, and you will become familiar with them as we go along. The goal is to get you up and running with a solid development environment that will support your learning and projects.
