### Sidebar: Capstone Project Vision

It seems like the minute someone writes content or releases software, it is out of date. Nearly
every resource referenced in this series, for example, has been changed (or become out of date) since
that content, library, VS Code extension or API was initially created.

> When is the last time you were able to work through a coding tutorial that *wasn't* out of date?

What if we could create an application that, when "pointed at" something like 
a coding tutorial, kept that content up-to-date?

What if we had an application that could keep a SaaS application's documentation
up to date by "using" the app, comparing current functionality with its documentation, then 
*updating* that documentation to make it match current functionality?

This is the vision for our capstone project.

> Wait! Wouldn't that kind of change the world? *Can it even be done?* 

***What do you think?*** Is this a worthy challenge?
